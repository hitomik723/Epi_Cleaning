## Who This Book Is For

This book is written for epidemiologists who use or are interested in using R to **clean public health data** such as epidemiological data. The best use of this book is for cleaning and transforming epidemiological data, but most of the contents of the book are applicable for non-epidemiological data such as education data or sales data.

## Sample Data Used In This Book

This book uses the following synthetic data set downloaded from [SyntheticMass](https://synthea.mitre.org/downloads). 

* COVID-19 10K, CSV
  + Ten thousand synthetic patients records with COVID-19 in the CSV format.

## General Rule of Data Transformation

1. Set up your development environment
    + Install/Load packages
    + Set up working directories
    + Create folder paths
    + Create time stamps
    + Create connections to databases/applications

2. Load input files
    + Read input files that have a specific word in the title
    + Stop the transformation if:
      * the input files are not updated since the last transformation time.
      * there are any invalid values in the input files (i.e., record IDs with missing digits, non-UTF-8 values).

3. Rename field/variable names
    + Load a mapping file.
    
4. Subset input data
    + Extract the data you want to clean or transform

5. Transform data
    + Recode existing fields/variables
    + Create new fields/variables

6. Merge/Join data

7. Subset columns for export
    + Load header files (templates) for export

8. Export data

9. Save back-up data
    + Move input files to archive

## Organzie your R scripts
If you have more than 1,000 lines in your script, I would recommend splitting the code into multiple scripts as follows:

1. Main script - This is an R script you run and sources the other script.

2. Function script - This is an R script where we write only functions on.
